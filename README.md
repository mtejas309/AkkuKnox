# Portfolio  (React + Vite)

This project is a **personal portfolio ** built with **React + Vite**.
Itâ€™s designed to showcase my projects dynamically and interactively, allowing visitors to explore my work with ease.

## ðŸš€ Features

* **Dynamic project categories & cards:**
  The portfolio layout is driven by a JSON object.
  Each category (e.g., Web Apps, UI/UX, Other Projects) contains multiple project cards.

* **Add & remove projects easily:**
  New projects can be added or removed from categories dynamically, making it easy to keep the portfolio up-to-date.

* **Search functionality:**
  Quickly search for projects across all categories by name or technology.

* **Vite + React setup:**
  Fast development with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for smooth coding experience.

* **Centralized State Management:**
  Redux Toolkit manages the entire portfolio layout (categories and projects) as a single, predictable state object.

* **Interactive & responsive design:**
  Fully responsive UI that looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
